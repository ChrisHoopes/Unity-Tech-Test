## Controls
* WASD - movement
* Shift - run
* Space - jump
* Mouse - aim
* Left Mouse Button - interact

## Directions

* Create a fork of the Tech Test repo
* Make the following changes (all script changes should be done in the Tech Test folder):
    * Fix any compile or playability bugs
    * Add a new green collectible coin worth 5 points
    * Display the player's coin count on the HUD
    * Animate the coins so they bob up and down in addition to spinning
    * Implement occlusion culling so that objects that aren't seen aren't rendered
